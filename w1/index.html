    <p><h4>&emsp;&emsp;I'm from Franklin, MA and Graduated from Tri-County RVTHS from the Computer Information Systems program. A few of my hobbies include: Exercising, snowboarding, longboarding and &emsp;&emsp;video games. I've taken a few courses on HTML during HS and was able to use my notes to catch up on a few things I had trouble understanding. My career focus is to work as a network or cloud &emsp;&emsp;engineer.</h4></p>
