                <h3><p>I'm from Franklin, MA and Graduated from Tri-County RVTHS from the Computer Information Systems program. A few of my hobbies include: Exercising, snowboarding, longboarding and video games. I've taken a few courses on HTML during HS and was able to use my notes to catch up on a few things I had trouble understanding. For the past 2 years, I've worked as a Level II IT Technician through an internship program at my high school which helped me figure out what I really wanted to do for my career. Currently, my career focus is to work as a network or cloud engineer as networking has always been my passion.</p></h3>
